Codes for IRW- and DRW- indices in manuscript "Link Prediction in Directed Networks: The Role of Reciprocal Links"
See the manuscript for more details. NOTICE that: 
1) RUN "./main.m" to utilize all link prediction methods in eight networks. Results are saved as "temp_results.mat" and "temp_results_ratio.mat". The latter contains all performances under different partition ratios. 
2) RUN "./analysis/Calc_Zscore.m" to calculate the Z-scores of original network and null models. The null models are generated maintaining the number of reciprocal links, as described in our manuscript. 
3) All datasets are downloaded from "http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/".
